            Um  espectrograma  é uma representação visual do espectro de frequências de um sinal, conforme ele varia com o tempo. Quando aplicados a um sinal de áudio,  os espectrogramas  são às vezes chamados de sonogramas, voiceprints ou voicegramas. Quando os dados são representados em um gráfico 3D, eles podem ser chamados de cascatas.
